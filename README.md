# flapdoodle

Why another wordle thing? Wasn't this over in 2021?

Yeah, but the one i like to play, Quordle, has become unusable due to ads. And i think there is a variant I haven't seen with a variable number of simultaneous words.

Also, to experiment with a more interesting design. 
Using a variable font to squish some grids.
