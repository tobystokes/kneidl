# kneidle

Why another wordle thing? Wasn't this over in 2021?

Yeah, but the one i like to play, Quordle, has become unusable due to ads. And i think there is a variant I haven't seen with a variable number of simultaneous words.

Also, to experiment with a more interesting design. 
Using a variable font to squish some grids.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

`npm prebuild` randomises the wordlist, but don't commit the changes - the repo version should be alphabetised so if we add words, we can see where...

### Deploy

It gets sent to Vercel automagically.
